## About the project
Rental Resume is a simple [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) single page application. It was made as a proof of concept by [@chrisheninger](https://github.com/chrisheninger) and [@ryanwiemer](https://github.com/ryanwiemer) in early 2016.

If you have an idea for a new feature or something that could make this better we would love to hear your feedback. If you notice that we're doing anything in our code that looks wrong– or if you have a question about why we did something the way we did– please let us know!
