## About the project
Rental Resume is a simple [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) single page application. It was made as a proof of concept by [@chrisheninger](https://github.com/chrisheninger) and [@ryanwiemer](https://github.com/ryanwiemer). If you have a great idea for a new feature or something to make it better we would love to hear your feedback. If you notice that we're doing something in our code that would be considered an antipattern, or you have a question about why we did something the way we did, please let us know!
